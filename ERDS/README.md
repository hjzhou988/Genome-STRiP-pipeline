# ERDS
## overview
ERDS (estimation by read depth with single-nucleotide variants) combines read depth, paired-end information, and polymorphism data primarily by using a paired Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Via different procedures, ERDS can identify CNVs that are in uniquely mappable regions of the genome as well as those that are not [1]. The flow chart of ERDS is shown below.

Of note, ERDS uses "split read" to accurately call the breakpoint of deletions. 
In addition to the bam file, ERDS also needs SNP VCF file as input. If you have a multi-sample VCF, you had better split it into single sample VCF, as it will significantly improves ERDS efficiency. ERDS uses about 20G memory for one sample. (h_data=10G or 12G might work, but if it gets killed or there is error message in the log file, then increase the memory)
It takes about a day to finish.
