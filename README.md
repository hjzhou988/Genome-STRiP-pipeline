# Structural_Variants_pipeline
This pipeline consists of Genome STRiP, LUMPY, ERDS, and CNVnator 4 algorithms. FusorSV integrates the outputs from Genome STRiP, LUMPY, and CNVnator. SV statistics and Mendel errors calling are in the Statistics folder. I tested these algorithms using the samples( with paths) in the file called batch_all.list in Genome STRiP folder.
